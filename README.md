#Ciphers
Within the Geocaching community hints are commonly given in the form of encoded messages. The most common encoding method I've seen is the ROT 13 version of the Caesar cipher. I thought it would be fun to implement a more general Caesar cipher and some other ciphers.  

Explanations of the ciphers implemented so far can be found below.
