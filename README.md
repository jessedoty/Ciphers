# Ciphers
Within the Geocaching community hints are commonly given in the form of encoded messages.
The most common encoding method I've seen is the ROT 13 version of the Caesar cipher. 

This implementation allows for any amount of rotation however, with 13 being the default.

I plan to add implementations of other ciphers in the future.
